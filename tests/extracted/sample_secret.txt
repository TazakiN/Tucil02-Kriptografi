This is a sample text file for testing steganography.

You can use this file as a secret message to embed into audio files.

The steganography application supports various file types:
- Text files (.txt)
- Image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) 
- PDF files (.pdf)
- Any binary file

Features to test:
1. Basic embed and extract
2. Encryption with Extended Vigen√®re Cipher
3. Random placement with stego key
4. Different n-LSB values (1, 2, 3, 4)
5. PSNR calculation

Tips for best results:
- Use longer audio files for larger secret data
- Start with 2-LSB for good balance between capacity and quality
- PSNR above 30 dB is considered good quality

Happy testing!
